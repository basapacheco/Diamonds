# Diamonds Analysis Project 💎💍

## Modern and Radical Approach

This project transforms the diamond analysis into an interactive and advanced application using modern techniques of Machine Learning and web deployment.

### Main Components

1. **Advanced Machine Learning:** Use advanced Machine Learning techniques to build accurate predictive models.
2. **Interactive Visualizations:** Create an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly for dynamic data exploration.
3. **Web Application Deployment:** Deploy the application in the cloud to make it accessible from anywhere.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Advanced Preprocessing and Modeling

First, we prepare our data and train a Machine Learning model using advanced techniques. Here, we use a Random Forest Regressor.

### Step 2: Create a Web Application with Dash

We will create an interactive web application using Dash. Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications.

### Step 3: Deploy the Application in the Cloud

To make your application accessible from anywhere, you can deploy it on a cloud service like Heroku.

Changes from the Previous Version

Previous Version
The previous version of the project focused on exploratory data analysis and basic visualizations using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook (Diamonds.ipynb) which included the following components:

Data loading and preprocessing.
Exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
Basic Machine Learning model training.
The previous version of the project can still be consulted in the Original_Project folder.

New Version
The new version of the project introduces a modern and interactive approach:

Advanced Machine Learning: Enhanced preprocessing and modeling using a Random Forest Regressor with hyperparameter optimization.
Interactive Visualizations: Creation of an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly to allow dynamic exploration of the data.
Web Application Deployment: Deployment of the interactive application to Heroku, making it accessible from anywhere.
